# Docstrings rules:
# 1. Ends with point.
# 2. Docstrings start and ends after and before code, without space between 
# there. (When you describe class, you should add one space line after that)
 
#  Module docstrings (__init__.py) rules:
# 1. Describe the classes, exceptions, functions, and obligations that can
