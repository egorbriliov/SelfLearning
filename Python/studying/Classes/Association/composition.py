Aggregation = A relationship where one object contains reference to other INDEPENDENT objects
              "has-a" relationship.
              Includes a reference to the object, not the object itself. When deleting a class object, the objects
              used are not deleted, only the reference to them.

Composition = The composed object directly owns components, which exists independently
              "owns-a" relationship.
              Includes an object, not a reference to an object. When an object of a class is deleted, the objects it
              uses are also deleted.
